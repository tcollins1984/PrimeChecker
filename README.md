# PrimeChecker
Check if a number is prime only using odd numbers to 1/3 of the numbers value.
Except for two, all primes are odd and thus will only have odd factors. 
For an odd number, N, the biggest possible factor is N/3. This function does not run through all the numbers up to (N+1)/2 
but only odds to about N/3 with a bit of an overshoot to ensure all relevant numbers are checked.
